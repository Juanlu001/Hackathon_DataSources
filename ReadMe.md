## The Basics
[http://mapschool.io/](http://mapschool.io/)  

An excellent introduction to mapping with computers, particularly for the web.



## Software

#### QGIS
[http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)  
QGIS is the best Open Source Desktop GIS package around. A good place to start for learning to use it is: [http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/)  

#### GDAL  
[http://www.gdal.org/](http://www.gdal.org/)  
GDAL is the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, a command-line set of tools for transforming and converting geospatial datasets.

## Online Services  

#### Mapbox  
[https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/)  
Mapbox Studio provides a free tier of subscription which iwll allow you to create performant web mapping applications. You can customize the symbology of OpenStreetMap data to your own purpose, add your own operational data, and create custom behaviors in pop-ups, etc...  

#### CARTO  
[https://carto.com/](https://carto.com/)  
CARTO.com is the newest iteration of CartoDB.com, and provided a great deal of developer-friendly geospatial data analysis and management functionality with the free account level.  You can even use CARTO to store non-geo data and call it through the SQL API or the DATA API, for use in websites using D3.js, etc...  

#### OpenStreetMap  
[http://www.openstreetmap.org/](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)  
OpenStreetMa is the crowdsourced map of the world, and one of the most complete sources of geospatial data, especially for developing parts of the globe. QGIS provides some great plugins for subsetting and downloading from OSM. You can also add your own data to OSM. THat's the whole idea!

#### Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Task Manager  
[tasks.hotosm.org  ](http://tasks.hotosm.org/)  

OSM Tasking Manager is a mapping tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OSM Team collaborative mapping. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping job into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping validated.

The application is an integral part of the work that the OpenStreetMap community does to respond to, and prepare for disasters, with geospatial data. 

## Code Libraries

#### leaflet.js
[http://leafletjs.com/](http://leafletjs.com/)
Leaflet.js is everyone's favorite mapping library, created for mobile, and so very performant in all situations. Super easy to use, and interoperable with mapping services that comply with OGC standards (WMS & WFS).

#### turf.js  
[http://turfjs.org/ ](http://turfjs.org/) 
Turf is a JavaScript library for spatial analysis. It includes traditional spatial operations, helper functions for creating GeoJSON data, and data classification and statistics tools. Turf can be added to your website as a client-side plugin, or you can run Turf server-side with Node.js  

#### simple statistics  
[http://simplestatistics.org/](http://simplestatistics.org/)  
Simple Statistics is a JavaScript library that implements statistical methods.

It helps coders harness the power of statistics and statisticians understand code. The library is exhaustively documented, written in a simple and friendly style, and thoroughly tested.  

#### D3.js  
[https://d3js.org/](https://d3js.org/)  

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

#### DC.js - Dimensional Charting Javascript Library
[https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/ ](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)  
  
dc.js is a javascript charting library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets (inspired by crossfilter's demo). It leverages d3 to render charts in CSS-friendly SVG format. Charts rendered using dc.js are data driven and reactive and therefore provide instant feedback to user interaction.

dc.js is an easy yet powerful javascript library for data visualization and analysis in the browser and on mobile devices.
